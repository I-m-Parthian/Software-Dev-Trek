## Data Project :: Unit Testing

#### Aim
To write RSpec code to test your IPL project.

#### Step 1
Create a sub set data. ie. choose 1 match of 1 season and only retain that data set.

#### Step 2
Refactor your code in such a way it can be tested.  
**Note:** functions/methods are the easiest to test, so try to put as much of code into function.  
**Note:** Testing plot (and images in general) are very hard to test. So do not attempt to test the plots. Instead focus on testing the data structure that produces the plot.

#### Step 3 Write RSpec tests for the IPL application.

Make sure of the following things ...
* well written README
* RuboCop config
* ```.gitignore```
* Make sure you git ignore csv files
* ```Gemfile, Gemfile.lock```
