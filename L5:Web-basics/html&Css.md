## Project I: Portfolio

#### Goal
Build your portfolio website using your knowledge of HTML and CSS. The display should work in all resolutions.

Use your knowledge of responsive media queries, CSS flex, and CSS grid for handling multi-column layouts.

#### Hosting
Host your website on [Heroku](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-deploy-a-basic-static-html-website-to-heroku/).

## Project II: Themed E-Commerce Website

#### Goal
Recreate the following [website](https://shop.polymer-project.org/), but with a theme of your own. Example: a shoe store, clothing store, electronics store, etc.

*NOTE*: This project is on HTML/CSS only, do not attempt to add functionality with JS. That part will come later. You should only use JS if it needed for widgets of frameworks like bootstrap.

#### Project Description
The website should have 5 pages:
1. Home Page
2. Item listing page
3. Single Item Page
4. Cart Page (hard code the items in the cart)
5. Checkout Page

#### Some pointers:
* Please work mobile-first.
* Use of a CSS framework like Bootstrap is encouraged but not required.
* Add README.md and .gitignore files to your repository.
* Make a common styles.css. Include it on each HTML page. Put the style classes here.They can be gradually reused.
* Work page by page, section by section, element by element. Break things down to the smallest step. Ask yourself what you don't know and figure it out.
* Try to work with high energy and complete things.

#### Hosting
