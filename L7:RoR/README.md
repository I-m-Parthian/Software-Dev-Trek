## RoR :: CRUD Project

In this section, you will build a simple Ruby on Rails project

#### Intro to Software Requirements

Software Requirements is a VAST field of study. It has many methodologies and takes years to master.
In this section, we cover a tiny fraction of the field, Just enough to write requirements for very small projects.

1. User Personas - [How to define a User Persona](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/how-to-define-a-user-persona/)
2. User Stories - [Writing User Stories](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/user-stories)
3. Wireframes - [Website Wireframes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website_wireframe)


#### RoR CRUD Project :: User Stories

In the RoR Simple Project, you will create your first web application.  

In this section, **you will only write the software requirements** for the toy project. The actual code will come in the next section.  

**User Stories**

Before you start coding your project, you will define the requirements for the project. For this project, we will use User Stories. [User Stories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story) are a lightweight way to capture software requirements, it is popular with proponents of Agile Development.  

**Tasks**  
1. Choose a domain for your project. Possible options are library management system, student management system, employee management system, etc.
2. Limit your requirements to ...
    * CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) operations
    * Authentication
    *  Registration
    * Error Handling  

You can find a sample [here](https://gitlab.com/mukund-mountblue/python-django-path/-/blob/master/blog-userstories.md)  


#### RoR CRUD Project

In this part of the project, you will implement the requirements you wrote in the previous part.

**Software**
You have to use the following stack for coding this app ...
1. Ruby on Rails
2. PostgreSQL
3. Ruby on Rails extensions like ...
    - device
    - any other RoR extension you may need

**Bonus**  
Implement full-text search with elastic-search.
