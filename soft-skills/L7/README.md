TakeAways:

* Building a good habit is difficult because most of us don't have a clear plan for the goal we want to achieve.

* So, It's important to give time and place to live in the world.
One must have a specific plan for each day.

* There are four stages for building any habit:
1. Noticing:
* Environment plays a vital role in developing any habit.
* Place the things related to the goal inside your environment for a constant reminder.
* Don't be the victim of the environment, be the architect of it.

2. Wanting:
* Put more steps between yourself and the habit to change.
* Oppositely put fewer steps between yourself and the habit to acquire. 
* More easy the route is more effectively the task can be done.

3. Doing:
* Outcomes of the things depend on the number of repetitions performed to achieve it.
* To acquire a habit, perform a task regularly such that it will become part of life one day.
* Optimise the starting line for initiating the task as some efforts are needed to start the task.

4. Liking:
* The reward is delayed for a good habit that's why difficult to keep liking or enjoying the task.
* Find out the way to enjoy the process at that moment.
* Don't break the Chain, and if breaks, never miss it twice.

Summary:
* Actions one takes, provide evidence of one's personality.
* No need to abandon your habits/personality to bring a change
* Changes are generally brought plank-by-plank.


> Moral - If you can change your habits, you can change your life.
 

## Atomic Habits (Book Summary)

[Book Summary of Atomic Habits - 11:11 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT7tQzmGRLA&ab_channel=AliAbdaal)

> Write about the book's perspective on habit formation from the lens of Identity, processes and outcomes?

* According to the author, "Identity change is the north star of habit change."

* It means, most of us work for the outcomes and don't enjoy the process to reach the goal thus it's difficult to build habit ( task as a part of your identity).

* Ideally, one must feel the change first then start the journey to be the change, also enjoy the path taken to achieve the goal.

> Write about the book's perspective on processes and goals?

* The author says that The purpose of setting goals is to win the game. And the purpose of building the systems is to continue playing the game.

* In the entire book, the author wants to convey the message to the readers that you shouldn't keep aspiring for the end-results. Because once the goal is achieved you will fall into existential crisis well or get stuck into the burnout phase.

* Instead, try to build a system where your goal becomes your habit and the entire journey will become your learnings.



> Explain the 4 parts of a habit?

According to the author, there are four stages for habit building:

1. Noticing:
* Environment plays a vital role in developing any habit.
* Place the things related to the goal inside your environment for a constant reminder.

* Outcomes of the things depend on the number of repetitions performed to achieve it.
* To acquire a habit, perform a task regularly such that it will become part of life one day.

3. Doing:
* Put fewer steps between yourself and the habit to acquire.

4. Liking:

* Find out the way to enjoy the process at that moment.


> Write about the book's perspective on how to make a good habit easier?

Make behaviour effortless:
- Keep the object in your surroundings for a constant reminder.
- Attach some initial flavour to it to make it more attractive.
- Reduce the steps between the habit and you
- Make it satisfying by adding some reward after the completion of the routine regularly.

> Write about the book's perspective on making a bad habit more difficult?

Leaving the bad habit is the opposite of what the author suggests for building the good one:

- Make things invisible from the surroundings
- Make it fugly or difficult to start
- Put more steps between the habit and you. So, it'll be hard to get
- Make it unsatisfying, attach a reprimand/punishment if performed any chance
